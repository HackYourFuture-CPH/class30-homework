Gaziantep’s Celebration Soup (Yuvalama Çorbası)

Ingredients: 
1/2 lb ground lamb (or beef)
1/4 cup rice flour
1 egg
Salt & pepper
1 tbsp + 4 tbsp butter
1 lb lamb stew meat, cut into bite-sized pieces
6 cups beef/lamb stock
1 can (~15oz) chickpeas
2 cups strained yogurt
1 tbsp dried mint

Instructions:
First, prepare the tiny meatballs. In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, rice flour, egg, 1 tsp salt, & 5-6 turns of fresh ground black pepper. Once the mixture has come together, form tiny meatballs, approximately the same size as the chickpeas. Set them on a parchment/wax paper lined cookie sheet. Refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium to large pot, melt 1 tbsp of butter over medium heat. Add the lamb, seasoned with salt & pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is starting to brown.
Once the meat is browned, add the stock to the pot. Bring to a boil and add the chickpeas and meatballs. Continue at an aggressive simmer until the meatballs float to the top of the pot, about 5 minutes. Lower heat to a light simmer and continue cooking for ~15 minutes.
Now, place the yogurt in a separate bowl and slowly ladle hot stock in with it. Whisk to combine. When the yogurt mixture has thinned and becomes slightly frothy while whisking, stop and slowly pour it back into the pot. Stir well and remove from heat.
Lastly, melt the remaining 4 tbsp of butter in a small pan. Once melted, stir in the dried mint and remove from heat.
Serve the soup with the mint butter drizzled overtop.
