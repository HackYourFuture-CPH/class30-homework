Ukrainian Borshch

Ingredients:
500g beef with bone (short ribs or shank for deep flavor) or pork
3 liters water
2 medium beets, peeled and grated
1 large carrot, peeled and grated
1 large onion, finely chopped
3 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
¼ medium cabbage, shredded
1 medium tomato, chopped (or 2 tbsp tomato paste)
2 tbsp vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bay leaf
Salt and black pepper, to taste
1 tbsp vinegar (to keep the beets bright red)
1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
Fresh dill and parsley, chopped (for garnish)
Sour cream, for serving
Instructions:
Prepare the Broth:
In a large pot, add the beef or pork, cover with 3 liters of water, and bring to a boil over medium heat.
Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
Lower the heat, add the bay leaf, and let it simmer for about 1-1.5 hours until the meat is tender. Remove the meat, shred or cut it into pieces, and set aside.
Cook the Vegetables:
While the broth is simmering, heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat.
Add the grated beets and cook for about 5 minutes. Add vinegar and sugar (if using), and cook for another 5 minutes.
Stir in the carrots, onions, and tomato (or tomato paste) and cook until vegetables are soft, about 7-10 minutes.
Add Vegetables to the Broth:
Once the broth is ready, add cubed potatoes to the pot and cook for about 10 minutes until they begin to soften.
Add the cabbage and continue cooking for another 5 minutes.
Combine Everything:
Transfer the sautéed beets, carrots, and onions to the pot with the broth and potatoes.
Add the shredded meat back to the pot, season with salt and pepper to taste, and let it all simmer together for another 10-15 minutes.
Finishing Touches:
Add minced garlic and fresh herbs (dill and parsley) to the pot and stir.
Remove from heat and let the borshch sit for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
Serve:
Ladle the borshch into bowls and top with a spoonful of sour cream.
Garnish with extra dill or parsley, if desired.
Serve hot with a slice of rye bread or pampushky (garlic bread) on the side.
Tips:
Borshch often tastes even better the next day as the flavors develop.
You can add beans for a heartier version or a bit of chili pepper for spice.
Enjoy this comforting, hearty bowl of Ukrainian borshch!
