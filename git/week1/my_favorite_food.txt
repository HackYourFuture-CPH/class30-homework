▢1 1/2 pounds crab meat (or imitation crab meat)
▢2 stalks celery
▢salt and pepper to taste
▢2/3 cup Best Foods mayonnaise (or Hellmann's)
▢1 teaspoon lemon juice
▢fresh dill optional, to taste

Instructions:
Break imitation crab meat into small pieces with hands, or coarsely chop with a knife. You can also coarsely chop in a blender or food processor.
