My favorite food is Basque Cheese cake

Basque Cheesecake Recipe:

Suitable for an 8-inch (20-21 cm) mold:

Line the mold with a layer of baking paper.

Ingredients:
Cream cheese(Philadelphia Smoreost): 445g
Sugar: 106g
Eggs: 4 (add one egg, mix well, then add the next one)
Heavy cream (Piskeflode 36%): 213g
Cake flour (or cornstarch): 18g
Instructions:

Gradually add all the ingredients in order, mix together, and sift the mixture once.
Bake in the oven at 220 degrees for 20-25 minutes.
(In my oven, I use top and bottom heat for the first 16 minutes, then switch to fan-forced heat for the final 5 minutes to brown the surface, for a total of 21 minutes.)
