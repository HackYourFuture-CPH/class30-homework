Ukrainian Borscht Recipe
(Borshch is a traditional Ukrainian beet soup, rich in flavor and color, often served with sour cream, dill, and sometimes garlic bread.)

Ingredients:
For the Soup:

2 medium beets, peeled and grated
1 large potato, peeled and cubed
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, peeled and grated
1/2 small head of cabbage, shredded
1/2 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 bay leaf
4-5 cups beef or vegetable broth (homemade is best)
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (or lemon juice)
1 tablespoon sugar
Salt and black pepper, to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
For Serving:

Sour cream (for garnish)
Rye bread (for serving)
Optional Add-ins:
1 cup cooked pork, beef, or sausage, chopped (optional for a meatier soup)
Instructions:
Prepare the Beets:

Heat a large pot over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.
Add the grated beets and sauté for 5–7 minutes, until they become tender. Stir frequently to prevent burning.
Add the tomato paste to the beets, mix well, and let cook for another 2-3 minutes to develop the flavors.
Cook the Vegetables:

In the same pot, add the chopped onion, grated carrot, and cubed potatoes. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to allow the vegetables to soften and become aromatic.
Simmer the Soup:

Add the broth (beef or vegetable), bay leaf, and shredded cabbage to the pot.
Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the potatoes and cabbage are tender.
Add Seasoning and Flavor:

Stir in the apple cider vinegar, sugar, garlic, and season with salt and black pepper. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
Finish with Fresh Herbs:

Add the fresh dill and parsley to the soup, then let it simmer for another 5 minutes for the herbs to infuse their flavors.
Taste and Adjust:

Taste the borscht and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add more vinegar if you like a tangier soup or a pinch of sugar if you prefer it sweeter.
Let the Soup Rest:

Allow the borscht to rest for at least 30 minutes after cooking, as this will enhance the flavors. You can also refrigerate it overnight for the flavors to develop even more.
Serving:
To Serve: Ladle the borscht into bowls and top with a generous spoonful of sour cream.
Garnish with more fresh dill, parsley, and a piece of rye bread or garlic bread on the side.
