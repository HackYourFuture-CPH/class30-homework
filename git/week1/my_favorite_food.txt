The rice:
Properly rinse the rice multiple times
After rinsing your rice multiple times, put in the pot and with the water and let it sink, and add your anis flower
when your sauce will be simmering, turn the heat on the rice pot, all the way up, until it starts boiling, then turn it to low heat
when you notice that there is no liquid anymore, set it aside and let it rest
The sauce:
Pre-heat a nice pan, that you drizzeled with enough olive oil
Roughly cutting the onions and putting them on the pan. The shape won't matter because we will blend everyting later
Add in the garlic and the ginger pastes
In the same fashion add the tomatoes and tomatoe paste
Let everything sear nicely until golden brown
Now you can add the sugar, remember to add salt to taste
At this stage, you can throw in all the spices except the mint, which we will keep for the presentation
Let everything fry on a medium-high heat, then add the vinegar, after which you should add the water and let it simmer nicely for about 40mn
While everything is simmering you should remember start your rice, and to move to preparing the cream, you can come back here afterwards
At this stage, your rice is ready, and so is the cream. After everything is nice and mushy, turn off the heat, and remove the bayleaves
Transfer everything to a big bowl that can stand very warm liquides
Use your hand mixer or blender to turn everything into a nice and smooth liquid
With the help of a sieve, pour the filtered and smoother liquid back in the pan, and add the butter
You can also add the bayleaves back, and make sure your thick sauce is nicely mixed with the butter
now you can add your cream and crush the dried mint in your palm over the pan
The cream:
In a blender add: your heavy cream and cashews. Some people like to leave their cashew in water so they are softer, not me!
Process everything until very smooth
Drizzle in your sauce pot at the end
