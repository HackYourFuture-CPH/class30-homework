Pork chops with rhubarb & grains

Rhubarb complements the pork chops in this dish perfectly, adding a touch of sharpness. Served with mixed grains, it's an easy midweek supper

Ingredients:
190g rhubarb, cut into 5cm lengths
1 red onion, cut into wedges
3 garlic cloves, bashed with skin on
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
olive oil, for drizzling
1 tbsp butter
2 rosemary sprigs
2 pork chops
250g pouch mixed grains
100ml chicken stock
parsley, to serve

Method
STEP 1
Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. In a small roasting tin, toss the rhubarb, onion wedges and garlic with the balsamic vinegar, 
a little olive oil and some seasoning. Roast in the oven for 20 mins.

STEP 2
Meanwhile, melt the butter over a high heat and fry the rosemary. Add the pork and cook for 2 mins on each side until nicely browned, 
then remove from the heat. Take the roasting tin out of the oven and add the grains and chicken stock and mix together. 
Add the meat and the rosemary to the roasting tin, placing the chops on top. Roast for 10-12 mins further, or until the pork is cooked through. 
Serve each chop with a big spoonful of the grains, scattered with parsley.
