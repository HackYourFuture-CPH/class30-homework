Pasta Marinara

Ingredients:
400g spaghetti (or pasta of choice)
2 tbsp olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, finely chopped
800g (2 cans) canned whole tomatoes
1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
Salt and pepper, to taste
½ tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for a bit of heat)
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried basil (or a handful of fresh basil leaves, torn)
¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
Parmesan cheese, grated (optional)
Instructions:
Cook the Pasta:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.
Drain and set aside, reserving a small cup of pasta water.
Prepare the Marinara Sauce:
In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
Add the chopped onion and cook for 4-5 minutes until it’s soft and translucent.
Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
Simmer the Sauce:
Add the canned tomatoes (crushing them with a spoon or hand for a chunkier sauce) to the pan.
Season with salt, pepper, sugar (if using), red pepper flakes, oregano, and basil.
Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a splash of reserved pasta water.
Combine Pasta and Sauce:
Add the cooked pasta to the sauce, tossing well to coat. If needed, add a bit more pasta water to achieve the desired consistency.
Serve:
Divide the pasta among plates and sprinkle with fresh parsley.
Top with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
Serve hot and enjoy your Pasta Marinara!
Tips:
For extra flavor, add a splash of red wine while the sauce simmers.
Fresh basil adds a wonderful aroma, so don’t skip it if available.
Enjoy your homemade Pasta Marinara!
