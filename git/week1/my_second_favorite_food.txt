My Second Favorite Food: Kebab

Kebab is a popular dish made from grilled or skewered meat, typically seasoned and marinated, often served with rice or bread. It’s a beloved part of many cuisines around the world.

Ingredients

- 500 grams of lamb or beef, cut into cubes
- 1 large onion, grated
- 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons yogurt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Skewers (metal or soaked wooden skewers)
- Lemon wedges (for serving)
- Fresh herbs (like parsley or mint, for garnish)

Instructions

1. Prepare the Marinade: 
   - In a large bowl, combine the grated onion, minced garlic, yogurt, olive oil, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper.

2. Marinate the Meat: 
   - Add the meat cubes to the marinade and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or overnight for better flavor).

3. Prepare the Skewers: 
   - If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 30 minutes to prevent burning.

4. Skewer the Meat: 
   - Thread the marinated meat onto the skewers, leaving a little space between each piece.

5. Grill the Kebab: 
   - Preheat your grill or barbecue. Cook the kebabs over medium-high heat for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are cooked to your desired doneness.

6. Serve: 
   - Serve the kebabs hot with lemon wedges and fresh herbs, alongside rice or bread.
