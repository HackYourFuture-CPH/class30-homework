Classic Pasta Carbonara Recipe

Pasta Carbonara is a beloved Italian dish from Rome, known for its creamy texture and rich flavors despite having no cream in the traditional recipe. The creamy consistency comes from the eggs and cheese, while the crispy pancetta or guanciale adds a savory depth. Here's how to make the best, authentic pasta carbonara:

Ingredients (Serves 4):
400g (14 oz) spaghetti (or your favorite pasta like fettuccine, rigatoni, or bucatini)
150g (5 oz) guanciale or pancetta, diced
3 large eggs (preferably room temperature)
1 large egg yolk
1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or half Pecorino, half Parmigiano Reggiano for a balanced flavor)
Freshly ground black pepper (generously cracked)
Salt (for pasta water)
Instructions:
1. Prepare the Pasta Water:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use about 1 tablespoon of salt for every 4 liters (1 gallon) of water.
Once boiling, add the pasta and cook until al dente, following the package instructions (usually 8-10 minutes depending on the pasta). Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.
2. Cook the Guanciale or Pancetta:
While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat.
Add the diced guanciale (or pancetta) and cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it becomes crispy and releases its fat. Be careful not to burn it. Remove from heat once done.
3. Prepare the Egg-Cheese Mixture:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the 3 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk.
Add the grated Pecorino Romano cheese (and Parmigiano, if using) to the bowl and whisk until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
Season generously with freshly ground black pepper—this is key to carbonara's flavor.
4. Combine Pasta and Guanciale:
Once the pasta is cooked and drained, immediately add it to the skillet with the guanciale (make sure the skillet is off the heat to avoid scrambling the eggs).
Toss the pasta in the guanciale fat to coat it evenly.
5. Bring it All Together:
Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing constantly to create a creamy sauce. The heat of the pasta will cook the eggs gently, making them form a silky sauce that coats the noodles.
If the sauce is too thick, gradually add a small amount of the reserved pasta cooking water (a tablespoon at a time) to reach the desired creamy consistency.
6. Finish and Serve:
Taste the pasta and adjust the seasoning with more black pepper or a pinch of salt if needed (but be careful with the salt since the guanciale and cheese are salty).
Serve immediately with extra grated Pecorino Romano and more black pepper on top.
Tips for the Best Carbonara:
Use Guanciale: Traditional carbonara calls for guanciale, an Italian cured pork cheek. It has a unique flavor and texture that pancetta can't quite replicate. If you can't find guanciale, pancetta is the next best option, but it won't have the same depth of flavor.

No Cream: The creamy sauce is made from eggs and cheese, not cream. Don't be tempted to add cream—this is what makes carbonara an authentic Roman dish.

Pasta Cooking Water: The reserved pasta water is essential for adjusting the sauce's consistency. Its starchy content helps the sauce cling to the pasta.

Serve Immediately: Carbonara is best enjoyed fresh and hot. The sauce can set if left to sit too long, so serve it as soon as it's ready.

Black Pepper: Carbonara is known for its bold pepper flavor, so don't skimp on freshly cracked black pepper. It provides both spice and depth to the dish.
