1 tablespoon duck fat or clarified butter
3 pounds duck legs (or chicken legs)
1 large onion, chopped (about 3 cups)
1/2 cup pomegranate molasses (see above for substitutes)
2 cups walnut halves, toasted and finely ground (about 1/3 pound)
2 cups duck stock (or chicken stock)
1/4 teaspoon saffron, (optional)
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
Pomegranate seeds for garnish (optional)
3 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish
Instructions
If the duck is fat, pierce the skin of the legs all over with a needle or the sharp point of a knife; do not pierce the meat. For most wild ducks you won't need to do this. Salt well and set aside.
In a large sauté pan, heat the tablespoon of duck fat over medium-low heat. Add the duck legs, skin side down and brown slowly, rendering the fat. Remove the legs as they brown and set aside.
Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent. Return the duck legs to the pan, skin side up. Add enough duck stock, cover and simmer gently for 1 hour.
Stir in the ground walnuts, pomegranate molasses and the spices. Cover and cook over very low heat until the meat is tender, stirring every 20 minutes or so to keep the walnuts from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Turn off the heat and add more stock or salt to taste. You want the stew to be very thick, but not pasty.
Garnish with pomegranate seeds and parsley and serve with rice.
Notes
One interesting option you can do to make the stew more red is to add 1/2 to 1 cup of grated, raw, red beet into the stew about 30 minutes before you serve. This mostly adds color, not flavor. 
Keys to Success
Duck legs, especially wild ones, can take anywhere from 90 minutes to 3+ hours. This dish can handle long cooking time, so it's done when the meat is tender. 
If you use chicken, it should only take about 90 minutes total. 
If you can't find the pomegranate molasses, sub in an equal amount of cranberry juice.
Serve this alongside Persian saffron rice. 
Once made, this will keep a few days in the fridge. It does not freeze well.
