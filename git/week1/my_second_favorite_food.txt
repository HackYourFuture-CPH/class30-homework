How to Make this Ghormeh Sabzi Recipe
Some argue Ghormeh Sabzi is our national dish–but there is some question on whether that accolade goes to our Kabab Koobideh (lamb kofte kebabs). But debate aside, if you ask a Persian what their favorite dish is, I guarantee you they will either name Ghormeh Sabzi or it will be in their top three. Here’s how you make it:

Cook the Aromatics
Cook the onion: Place a large stock pot on a medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, follow with finely diced onion, and cook until it turns golden. Add a clove of crushed garlic (optional).
Cook the beef: Add 1 1/2 pounds of cubed beef to the pan and stir until browned. Add 1 teaspoon ground turmeric and stir. Then add three cups of water to cover the meat. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to simmer and cover with a lid while you prepare the herbs.Beef for the ghormeh sabzi cooking in a large pot of turmeric and water.
Fry the herbs: Place a large frying pan over medium-high heat, add 1/4 cup of olive oil. Follow with a finely chopped leek. Once the leek has softened, add the finely chopped herbs (1 pound parsley, 1/2 pound cilantro, 2 tablespoons crumbled dried fenugreek, and the green parts of 5 scallions). Saute for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. 
Stew the herbs: Once the herbs have wilted and started to reduce in volume, reduce the heat to medium-low. Continue to stir for 15 minutes further. You are drying out the herbs to intensify their flavor. They will be a dark green color when they are ready. Remove from the heat and set aside.The herbs for the ghormeh sabzi being fried in a skillet.
Simmer and Serve
Simmer. To the pot with the meat, add the fried herbs, 2 cans of kidney beans (drained and rinsed) and 4 dried limes (poked several times with a knife). Add two cups of water. Stir and increase the heat to bring the stew to a simmer. Then lower the heat to cook further for a minimum of 1 hour and 30 minutes.Ghormeh sabzi simmering in a large pot.
Season the stew: Add salt, pepper, and lime juice to taste. Adjust the stew with water if required, the stew should be thick with herbs but with some broth for your rice to soak up.
