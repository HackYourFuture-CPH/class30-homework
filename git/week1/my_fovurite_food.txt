Turkish Sarma with Sour Cherries Recipe

Ingredients
1 jar of grape leaves (about 50 leaves)
1 cup short-grain rice (rinsed and drained)
1 large onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup pine nuts (optional)
1/4 cup dried sour cherries, chopped (or fresh if available)
1/4 cup currants
2 tbsp olive oil (for the filling)
1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped (or 1 tsp dried mint)
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1 tbsp fresh dill, chopped
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp allspice
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 tbsp sugar
1/2 cup lemon juice (plus extra lemon slices for garnish)
1/4 cup olive oil (for cooking)
Instructions
Prepare the Grape Leaves:

Rinse the grape leaves under cold water to remove excess salt. Blanch in boiling water for 2-3 minutes to soften them. Drain and set aside.
Prepare the Filling:

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent.
Add pine nuts (if using) and toast lightly.
Add the rice, stirring to coat with oil, then cook for 2-3 minutes.
Add the chopped sour cherries, currants, cinnamon, allspice, sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir well.
Pour in about 1/2 cup of water, cover, and let cook on low heat until the rice absorbs the water but is still slightly undercooked (about 5 minutes).
Remove from heat and add the mint, parsley, and dill. Stir to combine, then let cool slightly.
Stuff the Grape Leaves:

Lay a grape leaf flat, vein-side up. Place a teaspoon of filling near the stem end of the leaf.
Fold in the sides of the leaf, then roll it up tightly from the stem end to form a small, compact roll. Repeat with the remaining leaves and filling.
Cook the Sarma:

Arrange the stuffed leaves seam-side down in a large pot, placing them close together to prevent them from unraveling.
Add a few lemon slices on top and drizzle with the remaining olive oil and lemon juice.
Add water to barely cover the rolls, then place a plate on top of the rolls to keep them in place while cooking.
Cover the pot, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the leaves and rice are tender.
Serve:

Let the sarma cool to room temperature, then refrigerate if serving cold. Drizzle with extra olive oil and garnish with lemon slices before serving.
